Hello everyone! This is my first project. I made it two years ago, and now I decided to share it with you. My game is a Tetris written in C#, running entirely in the console. To render each pixel in this application, the character “█” is used. The code is bulky and hard to understand, but that’s not surprising since, as I mentioned, this was my very first project. The most important thing, though, is that the game works properly and without bugs (at least I haven’t found any).

The application has a main menu, as well as settings with basic parameters. You can see the menu and settings in the photos below.

The game is controlled using only the keyboard. When you launch the application, you start in the main menu. The current option is highlighted in red. You can switch between options using the up and down arrow keys or the W and S keys. To select an option or change a setting, press the spacebar. To return to the main menu, press Esc.

When you select the “Play” option in the main menu, the game starts. Figures are moved using the A and D keys or the left and right arrow keys. To rotate a figure, press the spacebar. Pressing the down arrow or the S key makes the figure instantly drop. To return to the main menu, press Esc. On the right side of the playing field, you can see the statistics: current score, current falling speed, number of cleared lines, and the high score.
